# Long Press

Long Press is a jQuery plugin to ease the writing of accented or rare characters.

## Demo & Usage

A demo can be seen here: http://toki-woki.net/lab/long-press/

Focus a form field and hold key to access alternate characters.
Try ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘u’, ‘i’, ‘o’ or ‘$’ for example.

Pick letter by:
- using mouse wheel;
- hovering over it with your mouse;
- using arrow keys.

Release key to confirm choice.

## Context

I wrote this plugin because I wanted to be able to insert rare characters as easily as on Android or iOS.
I learned pretty quickly after doing it that Moutain Lion already offers such a feature. This is called reinventing the wheel...

## Files

The most insteresting file in the repository is `js/jquery.longpress.js`. Other stuff is mainly for demonstration purposes.

## Status

The plugin is still very young and could be improved/optimized and stuff.

## Customization

Characters suggestions can easily be edited in `js/jquery.longpress.js`.
